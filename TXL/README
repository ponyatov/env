about =[
TXL is a special-purpose programming language designed for creating, 
manipulating and rapidly prototyping language
descriptions, tools and applications. TXL is designed to allow explicit 
programmer control over the interpretation, application,
order and backtracking of both parsing and rewriting rules. Using first order 
functional programming at the higher level and term
rewriting at the lower level, TXL provides for flexible programming of 
traversals, guards, scope of application and parameterized
context. This flexibility has allowed TXL users to express and experiment 
with both new ideas in parsing, such as robust, island
and agile parsing, and new paradigms in rewriting, such as XML mark-up, 
rewriting strategies and contextualized rules, without
any change to TXL itself. This paper outlines the history, evolution and 
concepts of TXL with emphasis on its distinctive style and
philosophy, and gives examples of its use in expressing and applying recent 
new paradigms in language processing.
