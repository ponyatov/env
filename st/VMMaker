In the distant past it was a major labour to create a set of VM code
from Squeak.

There are a lot of VM & platforms configurations in use.
To fight this problem I wanted a tool that would gather all the VM building 
jobs together in one reasonably convenient place. It should be both scriptable
and interactive.
