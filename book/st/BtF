Squeak is an open, highly-portable Smalltalk implementation whose virtual 
machine is written entirely in Smalltalk, making it easy to debug, analyze, 
and change. To achieve practical performance, a translator produces an 
equivalent C program whose performance is comparable to commercial Smalltalks.

Other noteworthy aspects of Squeak include: a compact object format that 
typically requires only a single word of overhead per object; a simple yet 
efficient incremental garbage collector for 32-bit direct pointers; efficient 
bulk-mutation of objects; extensions of BitBlt to handle color of any depth 
and anti-aliased image rotation and scaling; and real-time sound and music 
synthesis written entirely in Smalltalk.
