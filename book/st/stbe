This book covers all kinds of issues basic level, design, testing... I liked 
it a lot. The code and the book as a single file containing everything are 
available. Thank again Lukas Renggli for his effort for converting everything 
from Word. Thanks a lot Alec and thanks vendor/McGrawHill 
 They were really nice with us so think about it 
if you hesitate to buy one of their books. Not all the publishers are that 
open-minded.
