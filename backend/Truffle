JavGraal + Truffle : DLR for Java

comments @ https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9371931 {

Graal is a JIT compiler done in Java, it has nothing to do with DLR.
Graal is being used by Project Sumatra (GPGPU) and JRuby.

Truffle is more of a AST manipulation framework for nodes
that can be fed into Graal for compilation.

Then there are those meta-circular JVMs like JikesRVM which are done in Java.
