An alternative to SourceEditing is the idea that the core definition of a
 system should be held in a model and edited through projections.

To talk about this style of environment I find it handy to think in terms of 
multiple representations of the system:

representations  = [
editable representation: what you edit in order to change the system.

storage representation: the persistent record of the system definition.

executable representation: what is executed to make the system run - the 
executable.

abstract representation: used to manipulate and reason about system definition.

visualization representation: a non-editable view of the system definition.
