abstract = '
Parsing expression grammars (PEGs) are an alternative to context free grammars 
for formally specifying syntax, and packrat parsers are parsers for PEGs that 
operate in guaranteed linear time through the use of memoization. For a brief 
technical summary see the Wikipedia entry on PEGs. For more in-depth 
descriptions see the original PEG paper and packrat parsing paper, and 
related papers below. Bryan Ford, the maintainer of this site, coined the 
modern terms PEGs and packrat parsing, but much of their formal theory existed
 earlier and all the more recent work on this topic is by others.
